[Definition]

# Option:  actionstart
# Notes.:  command executed on demand at the first ban (or at the start of Fail2Ban if actionstart_on_demand is set to false).
# Values:  CMD
#
actionstart = <iptables> -N f2b-<name>
              <iptables> -A f2b-<name> -j <returntype>
              <iptables> -I <chain> -p <protocol> -m multiport --dports <port> -j f2b-<name>

# Option:  actionstop
# Notes.:  command executed at the stop of jail (or at the end of Fail2Ban)
# Values:  CMD
#
actionstop = <iptables> -D <chain> -p <protocol> -m multiport --dports <port> -j f2b-<name>
             <actionflush>

# Option:  actioncheck
# Notes.:  command executed once before each actionban command
# Values:  CMD
#
actioncheck = <iptables> -n -L <chain> | grep -q 'f2b-<name>[ \t]'

# Option:  actionban
# Notes.:  command executed when banning an IP. Take care that the

# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
# Author: Daniel Black
#
# This is a included configuration file and includes the definitions for the iptables
# used in all iptables based actions by default.
#
# The user can override the defaults in iptables-common.local
#
# Modified: Alexander Koeppe <format_c@online.de>, Serg G. Brester <serg.brester@sebres.de>
#       made config file IPv6 capable (see new section Init?family=inet6)

[Definition]

# Option:  actionflush
# Notes.:  command executed once to flush IPS, by shutdown (resp. by stop of the jail or this action)
# Values:  CMD
#
actionflush = <iptables> -F f2b-<name>


[Init]

# Option:  chain
# Notes    specifies the iptables chain to which the Fail2Ban rules should be
#          added
# Values:  STRING  Default: INPUT
chain = INPUT

# Default name of the chain
#
name = default

# Option:  port
# Notes.:  specifies port to monitor
# Values:  [ NUM | STRING ]  Default:
#
port = ssh

# Option:  protocol
# Notes.:  internally used by config reader for interpolations.
# Values:  [ tcp | udp | icmp | all ] Default: tcp
#
protocol = tcp

# Option:  blocktype
# Note:    This is what the action does with rules. This can be any jump target
#          as per the iptables man page (section 8). Common values are DROP
#          REJECT, REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
# Values:  STRING
blocktype = REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable

# Option:  returntype
# Note:    This is the default rule on "actionstart". This should be RETURN
#          in all (blocking) actions, except REJECT in allowing actions.
# Values:  STRING
returntype = RETURN

# Option:  lockingopt
# Notes.:  Option was introduced to iptables to prevent multiple instances from
#          running concurrently and causing irratic behavior.  -w was introduced
#          in iptables 1.4.20, so might be absent on older systems
#          See https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/issues/1122
# Values:  STRING
lockingopt = -w

# Option:  iptables
# Notes.:  Actual command to be executed, including common to all calls options
# Values:  STRING
iptables = iptables <lockingopt>

# Option:  blocktype (ipv6)
# Note:    This is what the action does with rules. This can be any jump target
#          as per the iptables man page (section 8). Common values are DROP
#          REJECT, REJECT --reject-with icmp6-port-unreachable
# Values:  STRING
